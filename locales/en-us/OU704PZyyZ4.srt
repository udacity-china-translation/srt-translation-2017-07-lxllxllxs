00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,500
When writing software, code reuse is the practice of writing generalized code

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,490
that can be relied upon to address a variety of similar goals.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,570
Whenever you notice that two parts of your code have similarities,

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,920
there's an opportunity to factor out the similar aspects of it

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,600
into some reusable library code.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,680
So that you won't have to repeat yourself in either of the two original places
